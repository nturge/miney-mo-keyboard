# Miney-Mo-Keyboard
Early composition for an unused keyboard element in the development of To-Make-A-Dadaist-Poem. Written in html, css, and javascript, the keyboard randomly loads items from an array to a virtual keyboard. The items in the array in this iteration are the words in the children'c counting song, Eenie Meenie Miney Mo, though the array can theoretically be loaded with other material. This project was developed using [netnet studio](https://netnet.studio) and is live at https://netnet.studio/?gh=nturge/miney-mo-keyboard
